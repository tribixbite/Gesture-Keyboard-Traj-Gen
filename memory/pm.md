# Project Management: Gesture Keyboard Trajectory Generation

## Research Takeaways

### 1. Literature Review Insights
- **WordGesture-GAN (CHI 2023)**: Uses VAE to encode gesture variations into Gaussian distribution, enabling synthesis without user reference gestures. Achieves better Wasserstein distance metrics than minimum jerk models.
- **Gesture2Text (IEEE TVCG 2024)**: Pre-trained neural decoder using coarse discretization achieves 90.4% Top-4 accuracy across diverse AR/VR systems. Key insight: discretization tolerates noise and generalizes well.
- **HCI Student Project**: SHARK2 algorithm provides template-matching baseline but lacks accuracy for noisy trajectories.

### 2. Technical Analysis
- **Jerk Minimization**: Physically plausible but produces overly smooth trajectories lacking human imperfections
- **GAN-Based**: Two modes (Transfer/Imitation) offer style variation but require substantial training data
- **RNN-Based**: Good for sequential dependencies but computationally expensive for real-time generation

### 3. Key Problems Identified
- Existing models lack realistic velocity profiles
- No proper noise modeling for human tremor/imprecision
- Missing temporal dynamics in most implementations
- Poor generalization across different keyboard layouts and user styles

2. **Testing Framework**
   - Comparative analysis across configurations
   - Word complexity metrics
   - Smoothness quantification via jerk analysis

### Phase 2: Hybrid Approaches (In Progress)
