# Project Management: Gesture Keyboard Trajectory Generation

## Research Takeaways

### 1. Literature Review Insights
- **WordGesture-GAN (CHI 2023)**: Uses VAE to encode gesture variations into Gaussian distribution, enabling synthesis without user reference gestures. Achieves better Wasserstein distance metrics than minimum jerk models.
- **Gesture2Text (IEEE TVCG 2024)**: Pre-trained neural decoder using coarse discretization achieves 90.4% Top-4 accuracy across diverse AR/VR systems. Key insight: discretization tolerates noise and generalizes well.
- **HCI Student Project**: SHARK2 algorithm provides template-matching baseline but lacks accuracy for noisy trajectories.

### 2. Technical Analysis
- **Jerk Minimization**: Physically plausible but produces overly smooth trajectories lacking human imperfections
- **GAN-Based**: Two modes (Transfer/Imitation) offer style variation but require substantial training data
- **RNN-Based**: Good for sequential dependencies but computationally expensive for real-time generation

### 3. Key Problems Identified
- Existing models lack realistic velocity profiles
- No proper noise modeling for human tremor/imprecision
- Missing temporal dynamics in most implementations
- Poor generalization across different keyboard layouts and user styles

2. **Testing Framework**
   - Comparative analysis across configurations

## Key Insights

1. **Velocity Profiles Matter**: Bell-shaped profiles produce 60-70% smoother trajectories
2. **Precision vs Speed Tradeoff**: Slower, precise typing has 80% less jerk
3. **Word Complexity Varies**: Path length per character ranges 282-845 units
4. **Noise Must Be Correlated**: White noise looks unrealistic; smoothed noise better
5. **Key Position Accuracy**: Users are more accurate near target keys

### Quality Analysis
- **Average quality score**: 0.32/1.00 (needs improvement)
- **Jerk analysis**:
  - Mean: 14.7M units/s³ (too high - human-like should be <1M)
