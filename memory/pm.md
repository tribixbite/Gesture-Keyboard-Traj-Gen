# Project Management: Gesture Keyboard Trajectory Generation

## Research Takeaways

### 1. Literature Review Insights
- **WordGesture-GAN (CHI 2023)**: Uses VAE to encode gesture variations into Gaussian distribution, enabling synthesis without user reference gestures. Achieves better Wasserstein distance metrics than minimum jerk models.
- **Gesture2Text (IEEE TVCG 2024)**: Pre-trained neural decoder using coarse discretization achieves 90.4% Top-4 accuracy across diverse AR/VR systems. Key insight: discretization tolerates noise and generalizes well.
- **HCI Student Project**: SHARK2 algorithm provides template-matching baseline but lacks accuracy for noisy trajectories.

### 2. Technical Analysis
- **Jerk Minimization**: Physically plausible but produces overly smooth trajectories lacking human imperfections
- **GAN-Based**: Two modes (Transfer/Imitation) offer style variation but require substantial training data
- **RNN-Based**: Good for sequential dependencies but computationally expensive for real-time generation

### 3. Key Problems Identified
- Existing models lack realistic velocity profiles
- No proper noise modeling for human tremor/imprecision
- Missing temporal dynamics in most implementations
- Poor generalization across different keyboard layouts and user styles

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Enhancements ✅
1. **Enhanced Generator Development**
   - Implemented polynomial interpolation with smoothing
   - Added three velocity profiles (bell, uniform, realistic)
   - Created correlated noise model with key-position awareness
   - Full kinematic chain calculation (position → velocity → acceleration → jerk)

2. **Testing Framework**
   - Comparative analysis across configurations
   - Word complexity metrics
   - Smoothness quantification via jerk analysis

### Phase 2: Hybrid Approaches (In Progress)
1. **Hybrid Generator**
   - Combines enhanced generation with optimization
   - Multiple style presets implemented
   - Blending factor for approach mixing

2. **Issues Encountered**
   - Matplotlib dependency issues (made optional)
   - Scipy interpolation unavailable (replaced with numpy)
   - Jerk-minimization module has hard matplotlib dependency

### Phase 3: Scale & Evaluation (Next)
1. Generate large-scale dataset (100+ traces)
2. Implement quality metrics
3. Compare with ground truth data
4. Performance optimization

## Key Insights

1. **Velocity Profiles Matter**: Bell-shaped profiles produce 60-70% smoother trajectories
2. **Precision vs Speed Tradeoff**: Slower, precise typing has 80% less jerk
3. **Word Complexity Varies**: Path length per character ranges 282-845 units
4. **Noise Must Be Correlated**: White noise looks unrealistic; smoothed noise better
5. **Key Position Accuracy**: Users are more accurate near target keys

## Generation Results (100 Traces)

### Success Metrics
- **100% generation success rate** (100/100 traces)
- **64 unique words tested** covering diverse complexity
- **4 style profiles**: precise (22%), fast (25%), natural (22%), sloppy (31%)
- **3 velocity profiles**: bell (38%), realistic (40%), uniform (22%)

### Quality Analysis
- **Average quality score**: 0.32/1.00 (needs improvement)
- **Jerk analysis**:
  - Mean: 14.7M units/s³ (too high - human-like should be <1M)
  - Best: 1.7M units/s³ (precise style)
  - Worst: 45M units/s³ (fast style)
- **Path characteristics**:
  - Average: 335.8 units per character
  - Variation: High (std: 1110 units)
- **Style performance**:
  - Precise: Best smoothness (4.9M jerk)
  - Natural: Moderate (13.3M jerk)
  - Sloppy: Higher jerk (18.2M jerk)
  - Fast: Highest jerk (20.1M jerk)

### Issues Identified
1. **Jerk values 10-40x higher than expected** - need better smoothing
2. **Quality scores low** - only 38% achieve medium quality
3. **Path length inconsistent** - too much variation per character

### Improvements Needed
1. Enhance smoothing algorithms to reduce jerk
2. Better velocity profile implementation
3. More realistic noise modeling
4. Parameter tuning for each style

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Dependency Issues**: ✅ Made matplotlib optional, replaced scipy functions
- **Performance**: May need optimization for real-time use
- **Generalization**: Need to test on more keyboard layouts

### Quality Risks
- **Validation**: No ground truth comparison yet
- **User Variation**: Limited style modeling
- **Edge Cases**: Short words, repeated letters need testing
- **High Jerk Values**: Currently 10-40x higher than realistic values
